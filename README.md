# nominal_tense
The data I used for my research "Nominal Tense and Semantically Similar Markers in Siberia as an Areal Feature" is contained in this folder.
The Excel file "Sample" contains two samples (Worldwide and Siberia) with the values I used for macro- and micro analysis.
The .R file "Nominal Tense Baklanov" contains the R code I used for Fisher's exact test in my macro-analysis.
